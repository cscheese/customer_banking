## Project Description 
This module is second of two modules on programming in python

### Brief Description of Challenge (modified from module assignment)
In this module I learned how to work with several files in creating a small banking app that calculates interest on savings and CD accounts. 

### Addendum/ Sources & References
Some of the code was created by reviewing past course Zoom sessions and following along; copying and pasting code from course examples and activites. I also used ChatGPT 4o and 4, Xpert Learning Assistant. I had a tutoring session. I also received help from my instructor in a post class session. I found it helpful to create the code initially in the Savings account and then copy and paste and then revise the code for the CD account. 


### Reflection
I opted to bypass this challenge initially because I was running behind with my homework, and instead try to keep up with the current lectures and challenges. So, this assignment is very late...but this strategy worked for me to help me not fall further behind.
